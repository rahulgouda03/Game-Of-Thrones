        Jon Snow. Ramsay Bolton. The stakes? Pretty much everything that’s wrapped up in good vs. evil, including control of Winterfell. Although Jon, Sansa, and their supporters discussed their strategy in detail, best-laid plans often go awry when Ramsay is
        your nemesis. From the moment young Rickon Stark was brought out, audiences knew this fight was going to be dirty. The sheer scale of the episode blew viewers away, and “BoB,” as it’s referred to by the show, was the epitome of gut-wrenching,
        even though our heroes emerged triumphant (thanks in no small part to a little ingenuity of Sana’s).
