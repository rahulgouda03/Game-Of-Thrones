        Two fan-favorite characters coming together after all these years? And for a sparring match? Fans loved to see it. The courtyard face-off with Brienne and Arya was a delightful full circle moment for both characters, showing truly how far they’d come
        since Brienne defeated the Hound in an effort to protect Arya. Even though fans knew neither character’s life was in jeopardy (a rarity for Thrones), the joy we got from seeing these women fight it out was more than memorable enough for this list.
